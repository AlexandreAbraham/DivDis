# DivDis

Unofficial WIP implementation of the paper [Diversify and Disambiguate: Learning From Underspecified Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03418.pdf)

## Status

For now, the model is implemented and a tentative of example on the four square dataset with more points than
in the example of the paper. I did not achieve to reproduce the perfect straight lines for each head.
